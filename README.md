The challenge: Consider a list of strings containing pairs of emails and a number of completed tasks in a month, separated by a comma. Build an algorithm to return the list of emails ordered by highest to lowest number of completed tasks. In case of tie (same number of completed tasks), order by email in alphabetical order.  The algorithm should return only the emails which have completed 10 or more tasks.  Please return an array with the ordered list of emails.

**Input:**

```
  [
    "robin@email.com,15",
    "leo@email.com,31",
    "jack@email.com,31",
    "james@email.com,1",
    "leonid@email.com,31",
    "anna.shmidt@email.com,9",
    "evafzt@email.com,20",
    "mario@email.com,21",
    "kevin@email.com,7",
    "george@email.com,30",
    "brunomars@email.com,21",
    "steven@email.com,9",
    "michael@email.com,0"
]
```

**Expected output:**

```
[
    "jack@email.com",
    "leo@email.com",
    "leonid@email.com",
    "george@email.com",
    "brunomars@email.com",
    "mario@email.com",
    "evafzt@email.com",
    "robin@email.com"
]
```
